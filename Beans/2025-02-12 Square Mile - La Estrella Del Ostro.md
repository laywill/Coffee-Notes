## Drinking Notes

Dates drunk: 2025-02-27 to 2025-03-15

I had some other coffee I was trying to use up - in hindsight, I should have abandoned that, and switched to this a little earlier to catch it closer to the optimum age for drinking.

- Super clean and fresh cup of coffee.
- Bright, lacking in bitterness.
- Minimal acidity.
- Ever so slight sourness when under-extracted.
- Did not taste great when over brewed and over extracted - became very "dry" and really not pleasant. Not one to leave in the French Press and forget about too long!
